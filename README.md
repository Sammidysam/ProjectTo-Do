ProjectTo-Do
============

A Python program, designed for Linux (especially Fedora), that manages to-do lists for your various projects.

To run,

`python src/todo.py`

In the future the program will be able to generate a .desktop file to be placed somewhere so that you can launch the program from the activities menu in Fedora.
